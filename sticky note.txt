Now the changecard value will always be exactly one of these four cases:
    'mixin,basalam' (when product exists in both)
    'mixin' (when Mixin product doesn't exist in Basalam)
    'basalam' (when Basalam product doesn't exist in Mixin)
Each check will overwrite any previous value, ensuring we always have the correct value for the current check.







I want to also add this option handler for get basalam product which is the follwoing endpoint /products/basalam/my-basalam-products/{vendor_id}

The responsible route for handling this request is the follwoing: 
@product_router.get("/my-basalam-products/{vendor_id}")
async def get_all_basalam_products(
    vendor_id: int,
    basalam_page: int = 1,
    token: str = Depends(access_token_bearer),
):
    result = await ProductController.get_basalam_products(token=token ,vendor_id=vendor_id ,basalam_page=basalam_page)
    return result

and it's controller is:
    async def get_basalam_products(token: str, vendor_id: int, basalam_page: int):
        method= get
        url=f"https://core.basalam.com/v3/vendors/{vendor_id}/products"
        headers={
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'
        }
        params={
            "page": basalam_page
        }
        
        response = requests.request(method=method, url=url, headers=headers, params=params)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            response = response.json()
            
            basalam_body = response
            return basalam_body
        else:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="we can't connect to the provider")

like previouse one


In productino mode, I want to send the following reqeusts:
/me endpoint - get to get basalam user data with the following details:

parameters: no parameters needs
header: "Authorization": "Bearer {token}"
body: no body needs

/my-basalam-products endpoint - get to get all basalam products data with the following details:

parameters: no params needs
header: "Authorization": "Bearer {token}"
body: no body needs


/mixin endpoint - get to get basalam user data with the following details: 
method: get
request path : https://mixinsalam.liara.run/mixin/{mixin_product_id} which product_id is hte product_id user clicks on and we handled that already
parameters: "mixin_url"which we stored it when user enter the credentials it had
header: "Authorization": "Bearer {token}"
body: no body needs

/basalam endpoint - get to get basalam user data with the following details:

parameters: "mixin_url"which we stored it when user enter the credentials it had
header: "Authorization": "Bearer {token}"

/update/basalam endpoint - get to get basalam user data with the following details:

header: "Authorization": "Bearer {token}"
body: we already made the request body in the code when we want to send udate reqeust in development api calls. fo this request. create one same as that or use that.

make this requset in production mode without making any confilict with develpment mode. by without makeing confilict with developement, I mean I want my frontend to handle these request seperately from what we have in development mode but, same as what we have in development mode to proccess the requests.

if we have them seperated, tell me and if not, create them and make sure they are all sending request to the proper url path
